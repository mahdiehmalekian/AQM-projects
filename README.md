# AQM-projects
In this repo, I put my projects for AQM's training program in data science.
* "Bus stop clusters.ipynb" contains my clustering of Bus stops in Metro Vancouver.
* "Arrival-delay-Final Analysis.ipynb" contains my analysis of clustering ~500K delay events of Translink in 2016, and "Arrival-delay-Clusters-Analysis.pdf" is a chart depicting 'defining features'
of each cluster.
