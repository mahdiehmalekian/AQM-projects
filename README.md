# AQM-projects
In this repo, I put my projects for AQM's training program in data science.  
* "Bus stop clusters.ipynb" contains my clustering of Bus stops in Metro Vancouver. "Cluster_10.png" shows how bus stop clusters (resulted from the analysis) naturally separate the cities (Vancouver, Burnaby, etc.)
* "Arrival-delay-Final Analysis.ipynb" contains my analysis of clustering ~500K delay events of Translink in 2016, and "Arrival-delay-Clusters-Analysis.pdf" is a chart depicting 'defining features'
of each cluster.
* You can find the slides of my presentation of above results in "delay events-bus stops.pptx".
