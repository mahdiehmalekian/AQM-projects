# Clustering
In this repo, I put my clustering projects. I did two projects, one clustering on the bus stops in Metro Vancouver, and the other clustering on Translnik's dalay events in 2016.   

You can find the slides of my presentation of both projects in "delay events-bus stops.pptx". Also, our group presentation at "Group_project_presentation.pptx".
