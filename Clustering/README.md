# Clustering
In this repo, I put my clustering projects.  

* "Arrival-delay-Final Analysis.ipynb" contains my analysis of clustering ~500K delay events of Translink in 2016, and "Arrival-delay-Clusters-Analysis.pdf" is a chart depicting 'defining features'
of each cluster.
* You can find the slides of my presentation of above results in "delay events-bus stops.pptx".
