# In this group project, we

1) Wrote an SVM routine from scratch in Python
2) Tested our own SVM routine vs. sklearn's SVM routine on BC Cancer data.

You can find my SVM code in "svm_all_kernels.py" which works with several kernels as well,
 including linear kernel, polynomial kernel and radial kernel. Also, in "kernels-cvxopt.pdf", I have explained how
I have handled incorporating kernels in the routine.

"Support Vector Machines.pdf" is our group presentation.
